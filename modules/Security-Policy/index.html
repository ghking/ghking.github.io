	<h1>Security Policy</h1>
	<p>We employ a number of security measures to help keep your data safe. Your information is protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) in transit, and 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) at rest.</p>
	<p>Our infrastructure is built on Firebase using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Firebase adheres to industry standard security, privacy and compliance controls, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>ISO/IEC 27001, 27017 and 27018</li>
		<li>SOC 1/2/3</li>
		<li>PCI DSS</li>
		<li>CSA STAR</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all of our systems, and routinely update them with the latest and most secure software to defend against vulnerabilities.</p>
