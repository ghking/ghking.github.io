                non-commercial
                transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be
                terminated at

                property or other violation of rights.</li>
            <li>Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or

            if
            we have or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such
            damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
            liability
