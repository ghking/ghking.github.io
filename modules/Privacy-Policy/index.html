        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Collection</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
            collect from you through our app.</p>
        <p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair
            and
            lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will
            be
            used. We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested
            service.
        </p>
        <p>We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to
            by
            law.</p>
        <p>Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over

            unable to
            provide you with some of your desired services.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal
            information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We protect your data within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised
            access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. To do this, we employ a number of security measures and
            update
            them regularly.</p>
        <p>Our infrastructure is built on Google's Firebase platform. Firebase adheres to industry standard security,
            privacy and compliance controls, including:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>Your information is protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) in transit, and 256-bit Advanced Encryption
            Standard (AES) at rest.</p>
        <p>We use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all of our systems, and routinely update them with the latest
            and
            most secure software to defend against vulnerabilities.</p>
