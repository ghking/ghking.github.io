Hi, I'm a software engineer living in New York City. I studied Computer Science at Northeastern University, and have worked at companies of all different stages doing everything from web and mobile developement to API and database design. I've even founded one of my own. I like making amazing products that people love. You too? Let's talk.

VIMEO

After school, I came back to Vimeo to head up developement on the flagship iOS app in New York. During this time, I helped usher in a formal agile process (https://github.com/vimeo/Blueprint) utilizing my experiences at process-heavy Runkeeper. This process is now being used across the entire engineering organizaiton. I focused mainly on iOS, but also contributed to the tvOS and Android apps.
