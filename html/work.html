	<p>After school, I came back to Vimeo to head up developement on the flagship iOS app in New York. During this time, I helped usher in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vimeo/Blueprint">a formal agile process</a> utilizing my experiences at process-heavy Runkeeper. This process is now being used across the entire engineering organizaiton. I'm the platform lead for iOS, but also contribute to the tvOS and Android apps.</p>

	<p>I started working at Vimeo as my third and final co-op. I worked on the iOS app and took over a native OS X desktop project which was used internally by the curation team. The LA office was eventially absorbed into the New York headquarters, but during this time the team was bicoastal so there was a lot of remote communication and collaboration.</p>

	<p>Runkeeper was the first job where I worked on the entire stack. When implementing a new feature, a single developer would usually build it on iOS, Android, and write any needed API endpoints. The user base was also huge so there was a ton of fun data to play with.</p>

	<p>I worked on TurboTax at Intuit, which had its own campus in San Diego. I wrote internal tools and automation software and was eventually asked to join a team writing prototype versions of TurboTax Online. We did a ton of really cool user testing with these concepts, complete with eye tracking software and one-way glass observation rooms.</p>

	<p>Instead of going back to my home in New Hampshire for the summer after freshman year, I decided to stay in the city and get an internship in my field. I was hired as a QA intern, but was quickly recruited to the mobile team to work on the Android app after they saw that I knew Java well and showed a strong interest in mobile.</p>
